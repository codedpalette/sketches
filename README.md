# sketches

This is a repository for my generative art sketches. I'm using TypeScript for all my works and various graphics libraries, such as [Pixi.js](https://pixijs.com/) and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), along with the pure WebGL API. You can preview them on my Github Pages [website](https://codedpalette.github.io).

## Installation

I'm using [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager. You can find installation instructions [here](https://pnpm.io/installation).

To install dependencies run

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Usage

### Development

Run a dev server with hot reload (will open in an Electron window)

```bash
pnpm dev
```

In order to switch to a different sketch, go to `<root>/index.ts` and update the following import at the start of a file

```typescript
import constructor from "path/to/sketch" // Update path here
```

### Production

Build a library bundle

```bash
pnpm build
```

Entry point is `<root>/lib.ts`. It exports all finished artworks along with a `Sketch` class for embedding sketches in pages

**TODO:** Generate JSDoc
